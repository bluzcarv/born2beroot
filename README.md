# BORN2BEROOT
*Project in C language part of 42 course (https://www.42sp.org.br/)*

###### In this project, I created my first Virtual Machine using Debian.
> This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.
